 A. OVERVIEW
 
 The Italian market for pleasure motorboats (including inboard, in-outboard,
 and pneumatic boats) has experienced an exceptional growth during the
 quinquennium 1985 - 1990, surging two and a half times its sales volume.  In
 1990, Italian demand for pleasure motorboats reached the peak of its high
 development phase.  This trend was even more accentuated by important laws
 issued by the Italian Parliament which somewhat alleviated tax burdens for
 pleasure motorboat owners.  After this period of astonishing expansion, the
 market has entered a new cycle, characterized by stability and even an
 inflection in its growth rate.  Nonetheless, this has not affected sector
 imports, which in 1991 experienced a 37% increase in sales volume (current
 terms) and covered approximately 50% of the market demand.  In particular,
 U.S. exports to Italy continue to play a preponderant role maintaining an
 import market share of 38.0%, and actually covering 19% of Italian sector
 market.  Notwithstanding "the party's over" atmosphere prevailing among U.S.
 domestic powerboat suppliers and a general slow-down currently affecting the
 European market, the "stars and stripes" production costs about 20% less
 than the Italian one and thus what is generally viewed as the "U.S.
 invasion" is expected to continue, with good sales for small and medium-size
 inboard/in-outboard and outboard motorboats and especially cabin cruisers
 and day cruisers.

 C.  MARKET ASSESSMENT
 
 1.  Market Demand
 
 In Europe the pleasure boat market has experienced a cyclic growth which
 reached in 1990 the peak of its high development phase.  This trend was even
 more accentuated on the Italian market after important laws issued by the
 Italian Parliament in 1989 which contributed to further boost its momentum.
 In brief, the inductive type of personal income assessment for Italian
 resident boat owners became less substantial.  In addition, the value added
 tax, one time doubled for boats over 18 tons was limited to boats over 50
 tons (approximately 20 meters in length) and a new category was created for
 small boat owners which pay a reduced VAT, more consistent with European
 levels.  Thus a 9% VAT was applied to small boats under 3 ton and 6 meters
 and 18.5 kW, a 19% VAT applied to hulls up to 50 tons, and a 38% VAT to
 hulls over 50 tons.  It is understandable how these laws have positively
 influenced the growth of the Italian domestic pleasure boat market which
 chalked up an amazing increase of 150% from 1985 to 1990.
 
 Since 1990 year-end, however, the industry has been experiencing a slightly
 weaker demand for pleasure motorboats.  Several factors have contributed to
 this end, including the decline in the overall economy with slower growth of
 personal income and the reluctance of pleasure boat consumers to take on
 additional debt, skyrocketing mooring taxes, and lack of an adequate
 infrastructure to support pleasure boating.  A pleasure motorboat is by far
 a discretionary purchase that can be postponed or canceled.  Thus, when the
 overall economy weakens, the demand for pleasure boats also declines.  The
 1991 introduction of outrageously expensive and differentiated annual
 mooring tax rates (e.g. an eight-meter motorboat currently costs
 approximately $1,000 instead of the previous $160) heavily contributed to
 dampen consumer purchases.  Many observers indicate that more affordable
 marinas and other infrastructures are also badly needed to boost medium-term
 demand.  Nonetheless, U.S. products, strongly desired by Italian dealers and
 distributors because of their innovations, special features, and very
 competitive prices, registered a further increase of 26% in 1991 sales to
 Italy.  Italian demand for U.S. pleasure motorboats is expected to fare well
 in the near future, although it is not likely to reach the astonishing
 increases of the recent past.
 
 2.  End User Profile
 
 Thirty years ago, there was one boat owner in Italy every five thousand
 inhabitants,  currently, there is one boat owner every hundred;  the future
 could perhaps envision one boat owner every 20.  Italy has after all a
 sea-faring tradition coupled with acceptable weather all year round.  In
 addition, the market should benefit from the fastest growing 35-to-44 and
 45-to-54 age groups.  The latter, especially, are reaching the maximum
 wage-earning period allowing them to consider such large purchases as a
 pleasure boat.
 
 Pleasure motorboats sold in Italy during 1990 (last official figure
 available) amounted to 4,915 units for inboard/in-outboard pleasure boats,
 7,459 units for outboard pleasure boats, and 13,267 for pneumatic boats
 totaling sales for $ 327 million.  Close to the same amount is estimated to
 have been sold in 1991, with a 50% increase in the import of the more
 comfortable medium-size inboard/in-outboard pleasure boats.  In 1991,
 Italian demand for smaller units slightly decreased, with 10% less imports
 of pneumatic boats, and 5% less imports of outboard models, notwithstanding
 the fact that the small motorboat segment is still by far the most popular,
 or rather the more affordable.
 Diesel engines are predominant in the inboard and in-outboard
 configurations.  This trend, generalized all over Europe, is even more
 accentuated in Italy.  Fuel economy cannot be considered an influencing
 factor due to low amount of hours per year of navigation for a pleasure
 boat.  The dominant criterior is the safety
