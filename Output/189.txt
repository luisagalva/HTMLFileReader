 A. OVERVIEW:
 
 Over the past few years the UAE has developed into a popular base for
 businessmen, tourists and industrialists alike.
 
 Worldwide the UAE and Dubai in particular is becoming known as an ideal
 location for trade investment, distribution and manufacturing operations, as
 well as a first-class holiday destination featuring many of the finest
 leisure facilities available anywhere in the world.
 
 The sea-faring traditions of the Gulf are well known and even though
 traditional sailing ships, dhows continue to ply their trade across the
 Arabian Gulf, today's vessels are dominated by the power boats and pleasure
 craft which have become very popular in the UAE.  Given the coastline
 attributes of this part of the world it is hardly surprising that
 watersports should be such a popular past-time here.
 
 A number of U.S. pleasure craft firms are represented in the UAE, such as
 the Boston Whaler, Glastron, Bayliner, Chapparal and Larson, but U.S. firms
 can still find capable businessmen interested in generating sales for
 products new to this market.  The water jet ski has become very popular in
 the UAE and is a fast moving product line.
 
 
 B.  MARKET ASSESSMENT:
 
 The UAE's pleasure craft market is based on the desire of individual
 nationals/expatriates to have their own pleasure craft.  The sea is
 accessible within an hour's drive for the majority of the residents of the
 UAE.  Local production is of a very high standard and offers quality at a
 very competitive price.  Exports of local manufacture are made on a regular
 basis to all the GCC countries and even to France, the Maldive islands and
 Finland.
 
 The UAE has a long coastline with no lakes or inland waterways.  Therefore
 all pleasure craft are used in the sea, and most models purchased are
 seagoing vessels.  Traditionally, low budget boat owners had to be content
 with small rowboats which were sometimes fitted with an inboard or outboard
 engine.  Today, they have the option to purchase inflatable boats or small
 crafts which are light, fast and reliable.  Lightweight boats are ideal for
 easy transport.  However, inflatable boats are not very popular here as they
 are not very good for use on the open sea under rough weather conditions.
 These are mainly used for scuba diving.  Another factor which works against
 inflatable boats is price.  A good quality inflatable boat with accessories
 could cost almost the same as a small craft manufactured locally.
 
 Between 1988 and 1990 annual imports of pleasure crafts to the UAE grew from
 U.S. $ 5.3 million to U.S. $ 13.7 million, an average annual rate of 60% per
 year.  The market's growth is expected to continue at an estimated average
 of 50% over the next 2-3 years.
 
 Total UAE imports during 1988-1990 were:
 
 1988    U.S. $ 5.32 million, of which $ 1.9 million was for yachts and other
         pleasure vessels and $ 3.3 million for commercial vessels.
 
 1989    U.S. $ 8.2 million, of which $ 3.2 million was for yachts and other
         pleasure vessels and $ 5.0 million for commercial vessels.
 
 1990    U.S. $ 13.6 million, of which $ 4.5 million was for yachts and other
         pleasure vessels and $ 9.1 million for commercial vessels.
 
 The UAE's total market for pleasure craft in 1990 was estimated to be nearly
 U.S. $ 27.2 million.  It is estimated that approximately 50% percent of this
 market demand is met by local production.  The total market appears to have
 an annual growth rate of over 50%.
 
 Locally manufactured boats are popular as they are of a very high quality
 and available at very competitive prices.  At present there is a joint
 venture between a British company and a local company.  Another Japanese
 firm (Yamaha) have just started a joint venture with their local agents
 building their own boats in Dubai with production starting early September
 1992.  Market sources predict that boat prices will drop in the near future
 due to the stiff competition of these joint venture operations in the UAE.
 
 Though boats manufactured locally are of a very high standard, the local
 market in itself is not very big.  Market sources estimate that
 approximately 60% of these boats are exported to other Gulf countries
 including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain.  It speaks volumes when one
 considers that some Scandinavian countries are buying boats which are
 manufactured in the UAE as it is comparable to those manufactured in
 Europe.  It is cheaper to produce a boat locally than in Europe due to low
 cost labor.  The main deterrent to increased export sales to EC countries is
 high custom duties levied on non-EC manufacturers.
 
 American boats are not price competitive in the UAE any more when you take
 into consideration high shipping charges.  American companies will have to
 seriously consider setting up joint ventures or their own manufacturing
 plants in the UAE if they want to maintain/increase market share.
 
 The important factors which have a bearing on who succeeds in this market,
 are price, service, promotion and commitment to the local agent.  Support
 and quick response from suppliers are esse
